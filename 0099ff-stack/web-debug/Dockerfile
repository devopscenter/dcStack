# Docker Stack - Docker stack to manage infrastructures
#
# WEB-DEBUG Container
#   This container is designed to provide an interactive debugging environment for the first step in a dev
#   workflow. Provides a connection to the db (via pgpool), and an additional ENV var (IS_DC_WEB_DEBUG) to
#   permit settings.py to install the django sslserver, etc for interactive dev.
#
# Notes
# - django ssl server: https://github.com/teddziuba/django-sslserver
# - to start the ssl server: "python manage.py runsslserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
#   responding on any ip address is needed because localhost means something different to the host, 
#   host vm (if any), and within each container. 
# - set the django site_base_url to "127.0.0.0:8000"
