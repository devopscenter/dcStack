#
#   DESCRIPTION: Install supervisor 4.1.x via pip install, and mimic installation 
#                structure and configs of apt-get install. Must be run after python
#                and it's pip is installed.
#
#                There is a single argument: "custom" if python will install supervisor
#                in /usr/local/opt/python/bin/, "normal" (or anything else if python 
#                will install supervisor in /usr/local/bin.
