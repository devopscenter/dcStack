# Required directories for this app. Note that this app requires a /media/data mountpoint prior to the execution
# of this script, whether provided by docker-compose (in containers) or by the instance creation.
# While simply creating a /media/data directory in the case where there is no temp volume would permit the app to run,
# the lackof space on the normal root volume would result in app failure fairly soon.
# Consequently, the best solution for this app is to simply specify an adequate scratch volume, mounted on /media/data.
